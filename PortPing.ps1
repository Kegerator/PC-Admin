3cx Ports
  Open these ports to allow 3CX to communicate with the VoIP Provider/SIP Trunk and WebRTC:
    Port 5060 (inbound, UDP) and 5060-5061 (inbound, TCP) for SIP communications.
    Port 9000-10999 (inbound, UDP) for RTP (Audio) communications, i.e. the actual call. Each call requires 2 RTP ports, one to control the call and one for the call data, so the number of ports you need to open is double the number of simultaneous calls.
  3cx Ports required for remote 3CX Apps & SBC
    Port 5090 (inbound, UDP and TCP) for the 3CX tunnel.
    Port 443 or 5001 (inbound, TCP) HTTPS for Presence and Provisioning, or the custom HTTPS port you specified.
    Port 443 (outbound, TCP) for Google Android Push.
    Port 443, 2197 and 5223 (outbound, TCP) for Apple iOS Push
  3cx Video Confernce
    Port 443 (inbound, TCP) must be allowed for participants to connect your 3CX System
    3CX System: Port 443 (outbound, TCP) must be allowed to connect to 3CXâ€™s cloud infrastructure
    Users: Port 443 (outbound, TCP) and 48000-65535 (outbound, UDP) must be allowed to exchange audio and video with other participants
  Ports required for Other Services (SMTP & Activation)
    SMTP Service: Cloud Service for SMTP Messages

    Ports that need to be open for plus series radios
    For internet traffic: TCP ports 80 and 443 and UDP ports 53, 67 and 123.
    For UPnP UDP 5000 (but since he can play UpnP files that port seems to be open already)
    For Chromecast to work as well as our smartphone remote app to work: mDNS discovery needs to be turned on.  This is typically on by default on most routers.
